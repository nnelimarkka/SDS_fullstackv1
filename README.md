# SDS_fullstack
* All modules are in their respective folders

# Installation instructions
1. download or clone the repo
2. to get each application working open commandline in the root folder of the application and run 'npm install'
3. After installing dependencies the application should start with 'npm start' or 'npm run dev' (nodemon required for dev)

# Running the project
* Project implements concurrently so following steps can be taken to run it (manually installing dependencies in each folder also works):
1. run 'npm intall' in the root project folder, this installs server dependencies
2. run 'npm run install:client' in the root project folder, this installs client dependencies
3. run 'npm run dev' in the root project folder, this will start both server and client
4. site will be accessible on localhost:4200
